# QuantumStrutsContinued


IMPORTANT - INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The parts (see below) use some Squad textures and models.  Unfortunately, in 1.7, 
the old model & texture have been deprecated and moved into the zDeprecated directory.
They are not directly accessible during loading.  This causes some textures to be missing.

To address this, I've provided a pair of scripts, one to be used on Windows and
the other to be used on both Linux & OSX.  These only need to be run one time


Windows Instructions
====================
Open the QuantumStrutsContinued folder in Windows Explorer
Double-click on the file Windows_CopyTextures.bat (note that on most systems,
you won't see the .bat)


Linux & OSX Desktop Instructions
================================
Open the QuantumStrutsContinued folder 
Double-click on the file:  BashCopyTextures.sh


Linux & OSX Terminal Instructions
=================================
Change to the GameData/QuantumStrutsContinued directory
Type the following:
	bash BashCopyTextures.sh
